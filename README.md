# FISH WEIGHT PREDICTION 

Using **Linear Regression**

With a dataset of fish species, with some of its characteristics like vertical, diagonal, length, height, and width. We successfully predicted the weight of the fish based on their characteristic. We used the **Linear Regression** Method to see whether the weight of the fish related to their characteristic.
